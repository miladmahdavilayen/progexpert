# Data Types in Python

## Core Data Types in python:
- ```int``` : Any whole number
- ```float``` : Similar to an int, but any number that contains a decimal point. 2.0 is a float. -4.34 is a float.
- ```str``` : Is a list. Anything that is surrounded by double or single quatation marks. Sequence of characters. "Milad" is a string.
- ```bool``` : Is one of the two True or False values. Like binary data 0, 1. They have to start with upper case T and F.
- ```None``` : It's data used to signify emptiness or nothing or 0.

## How can we check what the datatype of an object is:
- You can use the print() function to print any object and it also prints the data type of that object.
- type() function: will only return the type of that object.
